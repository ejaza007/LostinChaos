# Top-Down Shooter Game Framework

This is a C++ framework for a top-down shooter game developed using the SDL 2.0 Library. It incorporates Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles and includes A* pathfinding and ray tracing algorithms. The framework utilizes a game loop for managing various game objects such as players, objects, bullets, and effects.

## Features

- Object-oriented design for modular and reusable code.
- Integration of A* pathfinding for NPC navigation.
- Implementation of ray tracing algorithms for line-of-sight calculations.
- Smooth game loop for efficient management of game objects and events.
- Basic player movement with sprite animations.
- Bullet creation, movement, and collision detection.

## Requirements

- C++11 or later
- SDL 2.0 Library
- SoundManager library (not provided, but easily replaceable with your own implementation)
